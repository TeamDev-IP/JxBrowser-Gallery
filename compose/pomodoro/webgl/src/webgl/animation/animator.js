/**
 * Controls the given animation, if any.
 *
 * It has the following responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. Change the currently used animation.
 * 2. Play and stop the animation.
 *
 * When an animation is started, its {@link Animation#onFrame} is executed
 * along with the browser frame updates (usually, it is 60Hz, which means sixty
 * times per second). Right after it, the stage is re-rendered to reflect
 * the changes.
 *
 * Please note, as for now, this class doesn't support a fair pausing.
 * Pausing implies continuing from where we "paused". To implement such,
 * we should count for the elapsed time between pausing and continuation.
 * As for now, it is just not implemented.
