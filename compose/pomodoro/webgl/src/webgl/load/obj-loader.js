 * Loads a 3D model in `.obj` format from the passed files.

 * This format usually implies up to three files:
 *
 * 1) `.obj` file with geometry.
 * 2) `.mtl` file with materials.
 * 3) `.jpg` (or other image format) with textures.
 *
 * The first two should be passed to the loader explicitly. Textures are
