# Server-Side Chart Rendering with JxBrowser

This project demonstrates how to render and export HTML/CSS/JS charts on the server side using JxBrowser.

### Running locally:
```shell
   ./gradlew build
   ./gradlew :server:chart-rendering:server:run
```
After this, open `/server/chart-rendering/client/app/index.html` to launch the client side of the application.

The exported files appear under the `/server/chart-rendering/server/exported` directory.
