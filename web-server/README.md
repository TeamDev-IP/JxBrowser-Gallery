# Apps built with JxBrowser in the Web Server environment

This directory contains gallery apps that use JxBrowser in the web server environment.

### Chart rendering

The chart rendering app shows how to build and export rich HTML/CSS/JS charts 
using JxBrowser. Following the approach described in this app, you'll be able to:

1. Use well-established chart-drawing web libraries outside the web environment. 
   This example uses Chart.js.
2. Use frontend styling options for your charts, like Bootstrap or Material typography.
3. Perform an easy programmatic export to an image with a few lines of code.
4. Re-use the same chart-drawing code on the server side and the client side
   if necessary.

This example application utilizes a client-server architecture to highlight how 
you can build a user-friendly web UI for inspecting and tweaking the charts that 
later will be rendered on the server side. The same mechanism of rendering can also 
be used in desktop, console apps, as well as in any other environment where 
JxBrowser is available.

See the project README for more details: [chart-rendering/README.md](chart-rendering/README.md).

### PDF export

The PDF export app that demonstrates how to render and export the table data to PDF
on the server side using JxBrowser.

See the project README for more details: [pdf-export/README.md](pdf-export/README.md).
