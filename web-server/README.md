# Apps built with JxBrowser in the Web Server environment

This directory contains gallery apps that use JxBrowser in the web server environment.

### Chart rendering

This app shows how to render and export rich HTML/CSS/JS charts as images using JxBrowser.
Following the approach described in this example, you'll be able to:

1. Use well-established HTML/CSS/JS charting libraries on the server side or outside
   the web environment. This app utilizes Chart.js.
2. Use frontend styling options for your charts, like Bootstrap or Material typography.
3. Perform an easy programmatic export to an image with few lines of code.
4. Re-use the same chart-drawing code on the server and the client side if necessary.

This example application showcases a client-server architecture to highlight how
you can build a user-friendly web UI for inspecting and tweaking the charts and
then reuse the same code to render charts as images on the server side. The similar
mechanism of rendering, however, can also be used in a desktop app, a console app,
and in any other environment where JxBrowser is available.

See the project README for more details: [chart-rendering/README.md](chart-rendering/README.md).

### PDF export

The PDF export app that demonstrates how to render and export the table data to PDF
on the server side using JxBrowser.

See the project README for more details: [pdf-export/README.md](pdf-export/README.md).
